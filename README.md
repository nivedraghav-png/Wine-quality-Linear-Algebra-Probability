# Wine-quality-Linear-Algebra-Probability
A short assignment on Linear Algebra and Probability using wine quality dataset- Covariance,Eigenvalues and Distribution analysis

This project is part of my **Mathematics and Statistics Assignment**.  
It uses the **Wine Quality (Red)** dataset (1599 rows) to demonstrate:

## 📌 Tasks Completed
1. ✅ Handled missing values with mean imputation  
2. ✅ Extracted feature vectors (`alcohol`, `citric acid`)  
3. ✅ Built 2×2 covariance matrix (`alcohol`, `density`)  
4. ✅ Performed eigen decomposition (eigenvalues + eigenvectors)  
5. ✅ Analyzed most common wine quality & visualized distribution

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- File: `winequality-red.csv`  
- Features: 11 chemical properties + quality score  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 📸 Results
- Covariance matrix showing relation between `alcohol` and `density`  
- Eigenvalues/eigenvectors explaining variance directions  
- Most common wine quality: **5** (average wine)  
- Bar chart of quality distribution
